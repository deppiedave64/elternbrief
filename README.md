As part of a school project, elternbrief is intended to be a web application built using Django, allowing schools to digitally distribute letters to parents of students. Parents will be able to confirm these letters inside the application as well, reducing the waste of paper and also allowing said letters to be managed in a central way, relieving teachers from having to chase after forgetful students.

As soon as the project is finished, the whole documentation is going to be made available online.

## Deploying
1. Adjust elternbrief/settings.py (change database settings, timezone etc.)
