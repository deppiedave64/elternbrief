=== What is Elternbrief?
Elternbrief is a web application built using https://djangoproject.com[Django]. 
This repository contains a complete Django project ready to be tested on any system that supports running Python applications.

Originally started as a school project, Elternbrief aims to allow schools to digitally distribute letters to parents of students. 
Parents are able to confirm these letters inside the application as well, reducing the waste of paper and also allowing said letters to be managed in a central way, relieving teachers from having to chase after forgetful students.

=== What is the current state of the project?
Elternbrief is still in a very early stage. Most key features are implemented in a basic way but are far from being complete. 
Currently the interface presents an adventurous mix of text in German and English language, and there are quite probably more than a few bugs hidden throughout the code. 
Fixing the interface and getting the most essential features done will be my task during the coming months. 
Also, we will start with extensive testing with real users at some point soon in order to uncover other problems.

=== Requirements
* Python 3.5 or higher
* Some WSGI-capable web server (e.g. NGINX or Apache)
* Python packages:
    ** +django+ 2.2.3 or higher
    ** +django-tables2+ 2.1.0 or higher
    ** +mysqlclient+ 1.4.2 or higher
    ** +pytz+ 2019.1 or higher
    ** +sqlparse+ 0.3.0 or higher

TIP: The versions of the packages listed here are just a reference of which versions I have tested and that definetely work. 
The project might also work with older versions of these packages perfectly fine.
However, I always recommend using the latest version of every component as a best-practice.

NOTE: You can automatically install all required python packages by running
